# Discrete Mathematics 2 Calculator with Steps

This is not just a simple calculator, but a calculator that also provide ***step-by-step solutions*** for the following topics:

1. Modular Exponentiation
2. Trial Division
3. GCD with Pairwise Prime (unlimited amount of numbers can be calculated)
4. GCD Euclidean's Algorithm
5. GCD Benzout's Theorem
6. LCM (unlimited amount of numbers can be calculated)
7. Polynomial Congruence
8. Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)

and more to come.

**Features:**  
✅ Step-by-step solutions  
✅ Seamless and easy to use  
✅ Clears the terminal after each calculation for better readability  
✅ No need to use internet connection  
✅ No need to install any dependencies other than Python

**Demo:**

The main purpose of this project is to help students who are studying Discrete Mathematics 2 to understand the steps of each calculation, or teachers who want to provide a better understanding for their students.

Please do note that this project is still in its early stage, so there might be some bugs and errors. If you find any, please let me know by creating an issue.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Python Standard Library

## How to Use

1. Open your terminal and clone the repository  
`git clone https://github.com/absolutepraya/dm2-calculator.git`

2. Change directory to the repository  
`cd dm2-calculator`

3. Run the main file, then you can choose which calculator you want to use inside it  
`python main.py`

## Future Plan

- Create more calculators along the time
- Add input validation for each calculator
- Add txt log file to store the history of each calculation
