# Discrete Mathematics 2 Calculator with Steps

This is not just a simple calculator, but a calculator that also provide step-by-step solutions (might as well call it a solver) for the following topics:
- Modular Exponentiation
- Trial Division
- GCD Euclidean (soon)
- GCD Benzout (soon)
and more to come.
