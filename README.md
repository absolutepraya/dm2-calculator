# Discrete Mathematics 2 Calculator with Steps

This is not just a simple calculator, but a calculator that also provide ***step-by-step solutions*** (might as well call it a solver) for the following topics:
- Modular Exponentiation
- Trial Division
- GCD with Pairwise Prime (unlimited amount of numbers can be calculated)
- GCD Euclidean's Algorithm
- GCD Benzout's Theorem
- LCM (unlimited amount of numbers can be calculated)

and more to come.

## Future Plan

- Add more calculators along the time
- Make the it runs indefinitely until the user decides to exit
- Package the calculator using \_\_init__ and \_\_main__
